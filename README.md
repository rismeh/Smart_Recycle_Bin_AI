## **1. Concise & Professional**

This project involves building lightweight AI features using **TensorFlow Lite**, **Python**, **OpenCV**, and small cloud-based models. Core responsibilities include creating AI modules for smart waste recognition, sustainability interaction, chatbot assistance, predictive analytics, and image-based waste assessment. The role requires strong Python and TFLite skills, real-time inference optimization, basic cloud deployment, and collaboration with IoT and UI teams. Deliverables include optimized models, inference scripts, documentation, dashboard integration, and demo videos.

## **2. Detailed & Technical**

You will develop a suite of lightweight AI systems powered by **Python**, **TensorFlow/TensorFlow Lite**, and **OpenCV**, designed to run efficiently on edge devices and small cloud environments.
The tasks include:

* **SmartBin AI**: Build a compact TFLite model to classify recyclable categories (plastic, aluminum, paper) and detect contamination or incorrect items. Integrate LED/screen feedback.
* **Sustainability Mirror AI**: Implement camera-based detection for presence, reusable containers, and gestures, with real-time motivational overlays.
* **AI Chat Assistant**: Develop a small chatbot (via OpenAI API, LLaMA, or fine-tuned micro-models) that answers sustainability, event, and recycling questions.
* **Predictive Impact Engine**: Use sensor and usage patterns to forecast waste reduction, peak refill times, engagement trends, and waste distribution.
* **Waste Photo Classifier**: Build a lightweight image-based waste assessment model.

Skills include Python, TFLite, OpenCV, inference optimization, Firebase/FastAPI/Flask deployment, IoT data stream handling, and cross-functional UI collaboration.
Deliverables: TFLite models, inference APIs/scripts, dashboard integration, documentation, and demo videos.

## **3. Simple & Easy-to-Understand**

We need lightweight AI systems built with **Python**, **TensorFlow Lite**, and **OpenCV**. You’ll create:

* A camera-based SmartBin that identifies recycling items.
* A “Sustainability Mirror” that recognizes people, reusable bottles, mugs, and thumbs-up gestures.
* A small AI chatbot that answers questions about recycling and sustainability.
* A prediction engine that estimates daily impact and engagement trends.
* A quick waste classifier that works from a photo.

Skills needed: Python, TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV, basic cloud services, and some IoT familiarity.
You’ll provide optimized models, simple APIs, documentation, dashboard integration, and short demos.
